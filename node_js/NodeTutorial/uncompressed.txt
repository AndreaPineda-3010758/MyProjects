Jesus[e] (c. 4 BC â€“ AD 30 / 33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ,
[f] was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader.[11] He is the central figure of Christianity,
the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited 
messiah (the Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament.[12][13]

Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically,[g] although the quest for
the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how
closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus, as the only records of Jesus' life
 are contained in the Gospels.[20][h][i] Jesus was a Galilean Jew,[11] who was baptized by John the Baptist
  and began his own ministry. He preached orally[23] and was often referred to as "rabbi".[24] Jesus debated
   with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers.
   [25][26] He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities,[27] turned over to the Roman government, 
   and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect.[25] After his death, his followers 
   believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.[28]
